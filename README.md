JavaScript Assignment: Multi-Functional Calculator App
You need to create a multi-functional calculator app in JavaScript that can perform various operations and make decisions based on user inputs. This assignment will test your understanding of variables, data types, operators, conditions, and logical operations.

Requirements:
1. User Inputs
Use prompt() to take two numbers as input from the user.
Ask the user to choose an operation: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, or Division.
Ask if the user wants to round the result (yes or no).
2. Data Validation
Use type conversion to ensure the inputs are treated as numbers.
If the user enters invalid data (like text instead of a number), display an error message.
3. Perform the Operation
Based on the user’s choice of operation, calculate the result using the appropriate operator (+, -, *, /). Notes: you need Validate inputs here.
4. Rounding the Result
If the user chooses to round the result, round it to the nearest whole number using Math.round().
5. Decision Making
If the result of the operation is greater than 100, display a message: "That's a big number!"
If the result is equal to or less than 100, display a different message: "That's a small number."
6. One-Line If/Else
Use a one-line if/else statement to check if the result is odd or even, and display a message accordingly.
7. Switch Statement
Use a switch statement to perform the operation based on the user’s choice.
8. Template Literals
Use template literals to display all messages to the user.
Bonus Task (Optional)
Add an option to check if the result is a truthy or falsy value and explain why.
